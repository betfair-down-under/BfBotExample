# BetFair Custom Bot Example

This bot was developed to show a complete end-to-end bot using the BetFair API and the Ratings available at https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/horse-racing-tips/.  No validation has been attempted that it actually makes money - please check in with the Hub on many more advanced ideas on model development.

Many advances to this bot are possible and were covered in the presentation.  YouTube link for the presentation is pending.
